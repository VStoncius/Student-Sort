# Student-Sort
Demo project implementing sort algorithms

Demo can be run by Running StudentSortApplication. Demo features can be accesed using included postman collection. Both request must have a text file attached and 
sort type parameter (ex. merge, bubble, heap (this is not implemented yet)). Invalid sort types will be defaulted to merge sort.

Example input of a file:<br />
String1, 0.1<br />
String2, 0.2<br />
String3, 0.3<br />

Keep in mind that number are of type double, delimiter is , (can be modified in code). Each key/value pair should be in a new line
